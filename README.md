## User Experience
This application needs to be fast to use. It is competing with your phones notes app, a piece of paper and a pen and of course just your memory.

The USP of this site is to have a clean look which gives the user a clear oversite and easy to use features you can not find at it's competitors.

## Project Planning
This project is intended to help with the everyday life mission to go to the grocery store. With a working shopping list system you can make your shopping more efficient and be sure to come back home with the items you needed. With a sharing feature a partner, friend or family member can do the shopping the site user planned and in that way be of service in sickness and in health.

**Site Goals**
* Provide a quick way to write and handle shopping lists
* Have a nice look with good responsiveness
* Have easy to use features, especially on mobile
* Have a quick and secure way of sharing lists

### Agile Methods
This project was planned with agile methods. As some features depended on others to be built, the obvious way was to start with the most fundamental features and user stories first and work upwards. Since one feature had the label "Could have" it was planned to be built last, after the site was fully functioning.

### MoSCoW Method
The issues created for this site were labeled with the use of the MoSCoW method. That divides the labels into:

* Must have - features that is a must for the site to be working as intended
* Should have - features that the site should have to be of use to the user
* Could have - features that could bring that little extra to the user
* Won't have - features that no longer fit the project or won't be included in this release
