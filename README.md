## User Experience
This application needs to be fast to use. It is competing with your phones notes app, a piece of paper and a pen and of course just your memory.

The USP of this site is to have a clean look which gives the user a clear oversite and easy to use features you can not find at it's competitors.

With a working shopping list system you can make your shopping more efficient and be sure to come back home with the items you needed.

* Provide a quick way to write and handle shopping lists
* Have a nice look with good responsiveness
* Have easy to use features, especially on mobile
* Have a quick and secure way of sharing lists
